### About me

German trans girl who likes coding (useless) stuff.

I can program (kinda) well in:
- c
- zig
- c#

I love [esolangs](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language), my favorite by far is [asciidots](https://github.com/aaronjanse/asciidots)

### My setup(s)

**Desktop:** Ryzen 8 5800x, RTX 3050, 32 GiB RAM, one 2560x1080 and one 1080x1920 (yes, its vertical) display, Sony MDR-7506 headphones, Some Razer keyboard and mouse  
**Steam Deck:** 800x1200 built-in monitor, built-in speakers (except when I remember to take my headphones with me), some Epomaker keyboard and integraded touchpad

I use Arch, *btw,* with i3-wm and a little rice, I mostly code using neovim, though I still have VSCode installed in case I need it.  
For animation I'm using Blender, for music prodution audiotool is my choice, I use DaVinci Resolve for video editing and Krita for image editing (and of course I also use all the standard programs like ffmpeg and audacity).  
When I'm outside my house and thus cant access my desktop, I usually code in a codespace cause I can't get my usual setup onto my steamdeck 3:
