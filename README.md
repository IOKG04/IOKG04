#### About me

I'm a german transgirl who likes coding [(useless) stuff](https://github.com/IOKG04/TheDonutProject), making [abstract animations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzj33le0cz8&ab_channel=Rue), making [music](https://www.audiotool.com/user/iokg), and sucking at [chess](https://lichess.org/@/Rue04).  
If you wanna talk to me, you can do so on discord, my username is @rue04

I can program (kinda well) in:
* c#
* c

(even though my pinned repositories wouldnt quite suggest that)

I love [esolangs](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language), my favorite by far is [asciidots](https://github.com/aaronjanse/asciidots)

#### Some stats

[![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=iokg04&exclude_repo=Arduino-Projects&langs_count=5)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)

#### Ideas for some future projects

* asciidots interpreter that runs on the GPU
* program to view images in the terminal
* fullsearch chess engine (for lichess)
